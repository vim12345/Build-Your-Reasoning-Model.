#  Build Your Reasoning Model
# Overview
**You’ll create a local agent that**:

* Uses a structured “think step by step” format

* Can solve logic/math/factual problems with internal CoT prompting

* Allows experimentation with reasoning templates, instruction tuning, or custom logic chains

* We’ll simulate reasoning even without full model fine-tuning — just prompt engineering and internal chaining.

# Step-by-Step Implementation
# Step 1: Install & Pull Model
pip install ollama
ollama pull mistral  # or deepseek, llama3

# Output
You’ll get structured answers like:

# Question:
"If Alice has 3 apples and gives 1 to Bob, how many does she have left?"

# Response:
"She starts with 3 apples. She gives 1 away. So 3 - 1 = 2.
Final Answer: 2."

# Optional Extensions
* Add multiple templates: logic, math, facts, comparisons

* Add self-checking: have a verifier agent confirm the chain

* Build a Graph-based chain with LangGraph or Haystack

* Add fine-tuning data collection for actual custom model training
